<h2>How It's Made: </h2>
<p>Tech used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript

<p>
This was a lot of fun. I created this program because if there's one thing I wish I could be, it's a spy. 
But because I enjoy coding so much, I decided to merge the two. I wanted to create a fun cipher app. I utilized JavaScript string and array methods
to alter the data and return the changed data depending on the method used set by the user.
</p>


<h2>What It Does: </h2>

<p> This application allows users to enter a message to be encoded or decoded in one of three ciphers: Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, and Substitution Cipher. After selecting the cipher and method, the user can enter their message, and their newly encoded or decoded message will be outputted.
 </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned: </h2>

<p> This project taught me a great deal about string and array methods. It forced me to learn how to manipulate entered data and return that data modified
correctly.
If I had to redo this project, I would use a framework like React and include more complicated ciphers.
